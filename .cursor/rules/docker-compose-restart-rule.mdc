Docker Compose Restart Rule
Instruction:

Whenever a container needs to be restarted to apply changes (such as code updates, environment changes, or to resolve issues), always use:

pgsql
Copy
Edit
docker-compose restart <service-name>
where <service-name> is either frontend or backend (or another specific service).

Rules:

Do NOT use docker-compose down or docker-compose up to restart services except when absolutely necessary (e.g. you need to rebuild the image, update dependencies, or change the service definition).

ONLY use docker-compose build and then docker-compose up -d <service-name> if you have made changes to the Dockerfile or the dependencies, or if specifically instructed to do so.

For routine code changes, config tweaks, or general service restarts, always use docker-compose restart <service-name>.

Avoid using docker-compose up without -d to prevent accidental interactive/foreground runs unless specifically troubleshooting.

Summary:

Default: docker-compose restart <service-name>

Only rebuild: If Dockerfile/dependencies change, then docker-compose build <service-name> followed by docker-compose up -d <service-name>

Never use: docker-compose down or docker-compose up for normal restarts.

Example Scenarios:

Scenario	Correct Command(s)
Code/config updated	docker-compose restart backend
Dockerfile changed	docker-compose build backend
docker-compose up -d backend
Add new dependency	docker-compose build backend
docker-compose up -d backend
Quick restart after crash	docker-compose restart backend

Full rebuild required	Only if specifically needed, not by default
